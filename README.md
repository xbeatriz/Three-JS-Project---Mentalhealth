## üìñ About the Project

This project was developed as part of a university assignment to explore the use of interactive technologies in education. The goal is to:  
- **Explain** visually by giving the experience of what a person with 3 diagnoses can suffer in their day-to-day life. 
- **Simulate** the experiences of anxiety, depression and agoraphobia.  
- **Engage** users with interactive content.  

By blending education with interaction, the project aims to foster understanding and empathy.

## ‚ú® Features

This project simulates the daily life of a person dealing with three distinct mental health diagnoses. Each diagnosis is represented interactively and immersively, allowing the user to visually experience the challenges and emotions associated with each condition. Below are the main features of the game:

## 1. Entrance and Navigation
- The player begins outside a room with a soft, light ambiance.
- Upon entering the room, the light changes to a darker, heavier tone, representing the emotional weight of mental health challenges.
- The room is divided into three doors, each representing one diagnosis.

## 2. Diagnosis: Social Anxiety
- **Description**: Upon entering the first door, the player encounters three people conversing. When trying to join the conversation, the player begins to sweat and their head explodes, symbolizing the discomfort and fear of social interaction.
- **Interaction Method**: 
  - Use the **arrow keys** to move the character.
  - When approaching the people, a button appears to **start the conversation**.
  - The animation begins automatically when the button is clicked, showing the character's reaction to the situation.

## 3. Diagnosis: Depression
- **Description**: Upon entering the second room, the environment becomes dense with dark colors like gray and black. The space is filled with rain clouds, representing emotional weight and tears.
- **Interaction Method**: 
  - Use the **arrow keys** to move the character.
  - Upon reaching the bed in the center of the room, an option to **lie down** or **give up** appears, representing inactivity and the desire to isolate.
  - Clicking on this button makes the character lie down and stay in bed, symbolizing a lack of energy and motivation.

## 4. Diagnosis: Agoraphobia
- **Description**: Upon entering the third door, the environment transforms into a busy city filled with cars and noisy buildings. As the player tries to move, the background starts to turn red, and the character is pulled back into the previous room, symbolizing the panic of being in public spaces or open environments.
- **Interaction Method**: 
  - Use the **arrow keys** to walk.
  - As the character moves, the environment changes, and the character is pulled back to the previous room, representing the fear of open spaces and public places.

## üíª Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Three.js**: A powerful JavaScript library used to create and render 3D graphics in the browser. It is used to create the immersive environments and animations for each mental health diagnosis.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used to implement the game logic and interactions.
- **HTML5**: The core structure for the web page and interactive elements.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling the user interface and ensuring a responsive layout across different screen sizes.
